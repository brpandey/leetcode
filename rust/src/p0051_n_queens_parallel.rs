// N-Queens
// The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n√ón chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
// Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
// Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement,
// where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.

// Example:

// Input: 4
// Output: [
//     [".Q..",  // Solution 1
//      "...Q",
//      "Q...",
//      "..Q."],

//     ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
//      "Q...",
//      "...Q",
//      ".Q.."]
// ]

// Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above.
